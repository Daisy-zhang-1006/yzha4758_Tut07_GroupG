#### Intoduction
This project is a time based animated visual made with p5.js. Both the lively cow and the painterly background move smoothly, driven by real elapsed time, not frame count. Press spacebar to pause/resume the animaion and experience how timer-driven visuals create a unique rhtyhmic , and interactive artwork.
##### How to Interect
When the page loaded, the animation will play automatically.
- Colorful dynamic oil painting backround "flowed" like breath.
- Press Space button can pause/resume the animation, all the animatin will "stop" or "resume" at same time, indicate the "time based"
- Mouse and keyboard not influence the cow or backgournd directly, only used to pause/resume.

###### Animation Explanation
- I choose the **"timer"** to drive all animation, which is different from aduio, User input, and perlin noise
